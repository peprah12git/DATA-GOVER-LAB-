In reviewing QuickLoan’s data governance framework, I utilized the Data Lifecycle approach tracing information from Collection and Storage through Processing, Sharing, and finally, Deletion. At each stage, I assessed whether the organization complied with core governance principles such as Data Minimization, Lawful Processing, Classification, Security Controls, and Retention Management. My assessment revealed critical vulnerabilities: excessive data gathering at the Collection stage, a lack of classification and retention policies during Storage, and unmonitored machine learning bias during Processing.
Using Data Classification principles, I categorized loan applicant data as Sensitive due to its financial and personally identifiable nature. This classification immediately elevated the required protection controls — including encryption, restricted access, and retention policies. The absence of consent management created direct exposure to violations of Ghana’s Data Protection Act (Act 843).
To address ethical transparency, I proposed the Approval Rate Disparity Ratio (ARDR) as a governance metric. This metric compares approval rates across demographic groups and highlights potential discrimination trends. By visualizing it quarterly in a grouped bar chart, leadership can clearly identify unfair patterns and intervene early. This ensures that automated decision-making remains accountable, measurable, and socially responsible.
Overall, the review prioritized practical governance controls that reduce regulatory risk, improve data quality, and strengthen ethical AI accountability within QuickLoan’s fintech operations.
