Multi-Jurisdiction Compliance Response Matrix

Customer A: Abena (Ghana)
Analysis of legal rights
Abena has a conditional right to request deletion under Ghana’s Data Protection Act (DPA). Although the Act does not explicitly use the phrase “Right to be Forgotten,” it provides individuals with the right to prevent processing that is unnecessary, excessive, or causes distress. Where personal data is no longer necessary for the purpose for which it was collected, the data subject may request erasure or blocking of such data.
Since Abena has no outstanding orders, disputes, or ongoing contractual obligations, her request qualifies for lawful assessment and partial approval.

•	Assess lawful retention grounds
•	Delete non-essential personal data
•	Retain legally required records (e.g., tax/financial records)
